Introduction
In this project, we explore hotel booking data to understand cancellation trends and predict hotel booking cancellations. By analyzing various features related to bookings, we aim to identify important factors that contribute to cancellations. The dataset used for this analysis contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel in Portugal from 2015 to 2017.

## Dataset Details:
